const configuration = new Configuration({
  // Configure with your Client ID/API Key from https://dashboard.mx.com
  username: 'Your Client ID',
  password: 'Your API Key',

  // Configure environment. https://int-api.mx.com for development, https://api.mx.com for production

  baseOptions: {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/vnd.mx.api.v1+json'

});

const client = new MxPlatformApi(configuration);
